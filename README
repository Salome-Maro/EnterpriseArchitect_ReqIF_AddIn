What is it?
-----------

This small project is an Add-In for the modeling tool SparxSystems
Enterprise Architect (http://www.sparxsystems.de), in short: EA.
It enables the EA to import requirements from a Requirements
Interchange Format (ReqIF) file, resp. to export requirements to a
ReqIF file. The Requirements Interchange Format is a standardized
XML-based format (http://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF/) for requirements
interchange between organizations or tools.

The Add-In is developed using C#/.NET and #develop (Sharp Develop).

What is it?
-----------

This small project is an Add-In for the modeling tool SparxSystems
Enterprise Architect (http://www.sparxsystems.de), in short: EA.
It enables the EA to import requirements from a Requirements
Interchange Format (ReqIF) file, resp. to export requirements to a
ReqIF file. The Requirements Interchange Format is a standardized
XML-based format (http://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF/) for requirements
interchange between organizations or tools.

The Add-In is developed using programming language C# with the
.NET 4.0 Framework and #develop (spell: "Sharp Develop") 4.0.0.7070
as the IDE. The solution and project files are compatible with
Microsoft Visual-Studio 2010.
